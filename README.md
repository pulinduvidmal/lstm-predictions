## What is LSTM?

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to model sequences and time series data. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies and capturing temporal patterns in data. This makes them ideal for tasks where the order of data points is crucial, such as predicting future stock prices based on historical data.
